Description
----------
In this part, I mainly detect the presence of a colored ball using computer vision techniques. 
And then I track the ball as it moves around in the video frames, drawing its previous positions as it moves.

If you want to run it on your PC. You can download it directly or use 
`git clone` in git IDE. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/505788057/Ball-Tracking.git
```
